                    <h1>About Darkage Hunters!</h1>
                    <p>Darkage Hunters is a ROBLOX game inspired by the ROBLOX game called "Devil Beater", the gameplay
                        is similar, however, the story is entirely original. Schmaal is wondering about his older brother, bombbbird.
                        Bombbbird always wears this... weird... purple swordpack on his back and schmaal is going to figure out why.

                      <br><br>Little did schmaal know that a great journey was awaiting him.</br></br>

                      <br><br> Origin of Darkage Hunters: <br><br>

                      It all started with a bet that I made with a friend of mine, he said I should make my own "Devil Beater" type of game.
                      It started out with several minibosses and it went big really quick. and then I finally created the place, a little playable demo
                      with a mock-up story which was really silly. It got lots of attention so schmaal, me (bombbbird) and abe123awada started working on the real deal.
