            <h1>About us!</h1>
            <p>SkyTide is an amateur game studio with the goal of making games that
                gamers can enjoy. We are a tiny and a new group and not very experienced at the moment.
                At the current moment we are a ROBLOX game development group.

              <br><br>This will change in 2021 as SkyTide is aiming to be a standalone studio.</br></br>

        <h1>Meet The Chairman of SkyTide, RedTank.</h1>
        <h5>Jobs: artist, level designer, management, tester</h5>
        <p> RedTank is the man in charge of the decisions that SkyTide makes.
            He himself doesn't know how to code or program games, but certainly is artistic.
            RedTank himself is a digital artist and also helps with the art direction of the games we make!
            Ideas, concepts and prototypes will be checked by him and he will decide if the proposal is realistic and doable.
            He's the boss of bosses.

        <h1>Meet The CEO and Founder of SkyTide, AlexRay.</h1>
        <h5>Jobs: coder, artist, level designer, management</h5>
        <p> AlexRay is the founder of this studio. He may be the CEO of the studio, but is actually our main coder for the games.
            AlexRay communicates often between the member of SkyTide and the Chairman. It's a perfect place for him; he can code games but also still can manage
            important concepts for games. Despite being the CEO, He doesn't want to have too much stuff to manage, that's why we have our chairman! Despite being a coder
            AlexRay is also an artist of his own. He's also the one that coded this website.

            Yes, hello there you behind the screen.
